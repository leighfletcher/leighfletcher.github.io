Her preliminary analysis of rotational variation in ice giant emission presented at the COSPAR meeting in July 2018.\n Earth-based observations of both ice giants with the TEXES instrument on the IRTF and the VISIR instrument on the VLT have been reduced and analysis is in progress, with preliminary findings presented at the COSPAR meeting in July 2018.

Dr. Michael Roman (ERC PDRA) will continue with this analysis from September 2017 onwards.\n Dr. Julianne Moses (Collaborator) produced a seasonal photochemical model of both ice giants in the absence of dynamics, which was used to predict the appearance of both worlds using JWST (http://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.02.004); Joshua Tollefson (Collaborator) used our temperature inversions to explore thermal windshear in Neptune\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.04.009); and Prof. Patrick Irwin (Collaborator) presented the first detections of hydrogen sulphide above the clouds of Uranus using observations from Gemini (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-018-0432-1).\n The ERC team continue to advocate for a future mission to the Ice Giants, helping to write the science case for future entry probes for an ice giant atmosphere (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2017.10.005) and convening an Ice Giant session and workshop at the 2018 COSPAR conference in Pasadena, California.\n  ","date":1549919091,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549919091,"objectID":"7505a1c8518a7376ed45c7ec86026655","permalink":"https://leighfletcher.github.io/project/ice-giants/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T21:04:51Z","relpermalink":"/project/ice-giants/","section":"project","summary":"Ice giant atmospheres from ground-based telescopes and JWST.","tags":[],"title":"Ice Giants","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Recent publications have explored the moist convective plumes responsible for the revival of Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s South Equatorial Belt in 2009-2011 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.01.001), the 3-5 year cycle of expansion activity within Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s North Equatorial Belt (http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GL073383), and a review of cyclic activity across all of Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s main belts (http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GL073806).\n Dr. Arrate Antunano-Martin arrived in Leicester in October 2017 and is working with an infrared dataset spanning more than three jovian years (1983-2018) to identify periodicities and their underlying causes in the jovian atmosphere. The first of several papers on this topic has been published in GRL (https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL080382).\n Dr. Henrik Melin (ERC Collaborator) published a study using the TEXES spectrometer on NASA\u0026rsquo;s Infrared Telescope Facility, expanding on our previous work mapping Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s temperatures, clouds and composition on a single date (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2016.06.008) to understand the variations of stratospheric hydrocarbons over half a jovian year (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.12.041).

Two publications have been prepared by Dr. Fletcher that deal with Cassini infrared spectroscopy spanning the entire mission, 2004 to 2017: the first (published in Nature Astronomy) investigates the evolution of Saturn\u0026rsquo;s tropical oscillations in the equatorial stratosphere, and the substantial perturbation caused by the Great Northern Storm of 2010-2013 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41550-017-0271-5); the second looks at the changes occurring in the polar regions as Saturn\u0026rsquo;s northern summer approached (submitted). In addition, Dr. Richard Achterberg (Collaborator) has used the high-resolution infrared observations from Cassini\u0026rsquo;s final orbits to understand the properties of Saturn\u0026rsquo;s polar cyclones (https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL078157); and Dr. Sandrine Guerlet (Collaborator) used Cassini observations of Saturn\u0026rsquo;s limb to further understand the equatorial oscillations (https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JE005419).\n Dr. James Blake joined the Leicester team in March 2018, and is focussing on exploiting two sources of ground-based observations of Saturn: the first is a long baseline of infrared imaging from 1984 to the present day to study interannual variability; the second is the high-resolution spectroscopy acquired by the TEXES spectrometer on the IRTF to study the chemistry of the stratosphere. Proposals for new IRTF and VLT observations of Saturn have been submitted to the observatories.\n Dr. Henrik Melin (ERC Collaborator) has been working with Cassini UVIS data on Jupiter (an STFC-supported project), and the spectral inversion tools will ultimately be used as part of this theme to study Saturn.\n Guaranteed-time observations of Saturn\u0026rsquo;s north polar atmosphere and rings (programme ID 1247) using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have been awarded and prepared for execution in the first year of operations.\n  ","date":1549919091,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549919091,"objectID":"6b7c1fab64725e3e614f2239afdf25fe","permalink":"https://leighfletcher.github.io/project/saturn-seasonal/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T21:04:51Z","relpermalink":"/project/saturn-seasonal/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring Saturn's seasons from Cassini and ground-based telescopes.","tags":[],"title":"Saturn's Seasonal Atmosphere","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"TThis page lists my contributions to White Papers, Technical Reports, and Mission Proposals that are not published in peer-reviewed journals.\n Olivier Mousis, David H.
