      <description>Space School: The University of Leicester&amp;rsquo;s Space School celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2019, and I was invited to give a lecture on my planetary research to their &amp;ldquo;senior school&amp;rdquo; (16-18 year olds) in August 2019, focussing on future missions to the Ice Giants. I previously provided a lecture at the Space School 2016, on exploring giant planet atmospheres.
Space School UK are loving hearing about the exciting planetary science research of @LeighFletcher!</description>
