<h2 id="space-school">Space School:</h2>

<p>The University of Leicester&rsquo;s <a href="http://spaceschool.co.uk/" target="_blank">Space School</a> celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2019, and I was invited to give a lecture on my planetary research to their &ldquo;senior school&rdquo; (16-18 year olds) in August 2019, focussing on future missions to the Ice Giants.  I previously provided a lecture at the Senior Space School in August 2016, on exploring giant planet atmospheres.</p>

* Parkland Primary School (Jan 30th 2019):  An afternoon giving presentations and Q&A sessions with two yeargroups at the DSAT Parkland School, speaking with Year 5s and Year 1s (approximately 150 pupils in total).  The presentation tried to showcase the different scales of our solar system, from the size of their school to the size of the universe.  The questions were excellent and kept me talking.

* Discovery Schools Academy Trust’s Awards Ceremony (June 29th 2018):  Invited to Leicester City's King Power stadium to present the Science and Engineering award to one of their primary school students.  This included a short speech about the importance of science in schools for ~500 students and parents, before opening the envelope and announcing the winner.
* Discovery Trust Academy (DSAT) Schools Science Conference for British Science Week (March 17th 2018):  Welcoming address to 150 primary school students (7-11 years old) from eight Leicestershire schools.  "Thankyou so much for coming along today!  The children and staff were all buzzing throughout the day! I was so proud of the questions they asked, so Thankyou for allowing them the chance to ask them."

* Primary School Questions:  Answering 30 letters from St. Peters Primary School, Hinckley, Leicestershire (April 2012).  You can read some of my responses [here.](https://planetaryweather.blogspot.com/2012/04/school-explorers.html)
* Climate Video and Teleconference (June 2010):  The relation between planetary science and studies of the Earth’s climate, plus what it means to be a scientist.  Video and teleconference with St John the Baptist CE Primary School, Nottingham.
* Oxford Community College:  February 9th 2006: Science@Work organised by the Royal Society of Chemistry, this scheme introduces school children to adults working in industries which require science everyday - from dry-cleaning, to Army careers, to formula-one racing and exploring the universe.
* John Flamsteed Community College July 25th-July 29th 2005, Denby, Derbyshire.  The school had chosen to theme their ‘Gifted and Talented Student’ summer school around astronomy, so I was to be on hand to provide the ‘science element’ for what was otherwise a school about different learning techniques and team building.

## Secondary schools

* National Space Academy - Year 10 Careers Conference, National Space Centre, March 8th 2022. I delivered a lecture on the possible outcomes of degrees in Physics and Astronomy, but sadly had to give the talks remotely rather than in person:
