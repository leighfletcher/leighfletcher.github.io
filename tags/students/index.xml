      <description>Research Interests  Planetary atmospheres Spectral Inversion and Radiative Transfer Gas giants Earth-based observations  Biography Padraig Donnelly is a postgraduate researcher at the University of Leicester, specialising in the atmosphere of Jupiter. He uses a ground-based dataset from the Very Large Telescope in Chile to characterise the temporal variability in the Jovian troposphere and stratosphere as part of a wider ground support campaign for NASAâ€™s Juno spacecraft providing the much-needed simultaneous mid-infrared measurements for each approach as well as putting these into the context of the entire Jovian year leading up to and including the Juno epoch.</description>
